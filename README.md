# TkinterList
A GUI that allows the user to create and edit a list.

## The GUI
This was the third or fourth project for my Python I class to learn some basic aspects of creating GUIs.

This GUI allows for the user to type in an item or phrase and add it onto the displaying list. It includes created functions and buttons to add to the list, delete the last item of the list, and clear the entire list. The function for the add button specifically clears text from the entry box when adding to the display list.
